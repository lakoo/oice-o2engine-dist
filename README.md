# oice-o2engine-dist

Repository for storing o2engine distribution builds

Currently needs to be manually maintained because lack of CI on our side.

Version is defined as `x.x.x-y-z`
> `x.x.x-y` is version number from novelsphere.js

> `z` is the commit hash with prefix `g` or `o`

> `g` are novelsphere builds

> `o` are oice builds
